# KutumbAndCraftoAssignment

To run the code:
1. Appium GUI or appium server should be installed in the system.
2. Please use android studio or intellij preferrably to run the project
3. Please build the project once to let the dependencies settle down
4. One Automation test case can have multiple unit cases covered in it.
5. I have attached a video in the mail that video shows that the project works perfectly and is running all the test cses on the device
